# React Native Project with Skia and Flashlist

## Introduction

This project is a React Native application that utilizes Skia and Flashlist libraries to create interactive and visually appealing user interfaces. Skia is a 2D graphics library developed by Google, while Flashlist is a UI framework built on top of Skia, designed to create rich and performant UI components.

## Key Features

- **Skia Integration**: The project integrates Skia into the React Native application, allowing the use of Skia's powerful graphics rendering capabilities for creating custom UI elements and animations.

- **Flashlist UI Components**: With Flashlist, the application can leverage pre-built UI components and widgets to design intuitive and responsive interfaces.

- **Custom Graphics**: Skia enables developers to create custom graphics, animations, and visual effects that enhance the user experience.

- **Performance Optimization**: Both Skia and Flashlist are designed to be performant, ensuring smooth and efficient rendering of UI elements on various devices.
